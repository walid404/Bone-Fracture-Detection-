# Bone Fracture Detection

This project leverages the YOLOv8 model to develop a sophisticated system for bone fracture detection. The focus is on accurately identifying and classifying bone fractures from medical images to enhance early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Key Features

- **Model Implementation:** Utilized the YOLOv8 model, a cutting-edge object detection algorithm, specifically tailored for bone fracture detection.
- **Training Dataset:** Trained on the GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset, a public dataset provided by the Medical University of Graz, to ensure robust and reliable performance.
- **Performance Achievements:** Achieved a notable 95% mAP (mean Average Precision) accuracy in detecting bone fractures, demonstrating high precision and effectiveness.

## Objectives

- **Early Diagnosis:** Improve the ability to detect bone fractures at an early stage.
- **Proactive Treatment Planning:** Support medical professionals in planning treatments more effectively.
- **Enhanced Patient Outcomes:** Contribute to better patient care by providing accurate and timely fracture detection.

1)	Open Image: browse image from any path on device.( should be in png extension).
2)	Predict Image: pass the image to the model and display the predicted image(no.7).
3)	Save Image: saves image from on path on device.
4)	Clear Image: Delete image displayed.
5)	Quit: Exits the ui.
6)	Image before preprocessing and prediction.
7)	Image after preprocessing and prediction.
