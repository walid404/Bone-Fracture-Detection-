# Bone-Fracture-Detection
This project leverages the YOLOv8 model to develop a bone disease detection system but we focus on bone fracture detection. Training the model on a diverse dataset of medical images will accurately identify and classify various bone diseases. The system aims to enhance early diagnosis, enable proactive treatment planning, and improve patient outcomes in the field of bone health.
